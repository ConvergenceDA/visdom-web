Cumsum
- "query?/s/basics/|{field}/cum/thin/{count}"
- component modes:
    * compare metrics (all 0-100%)
    * compare populations

Map
- "query?/s/basics|{field}/a/{geo}|count"
- percentile scale
- double-click to fire a selection event

Scatter
- "query?/s/basics|{x}&{y}/rnd/{size}"
- hover behavior (tooltip)
- comparison with two queries: superset + filtered subset
- brush / filter behavior
- zoom in client-side?

Histogram
- "query?/s/basics|nObs/hist/100" -> columns: ["counts", "bin_min", "bin_max"]
- "junk" column: *actual* max value, or zero
- grouped bar chart?

Filters
- "staging" area for setting up the filter, then submit to add it
- checkbox next to each allows you to toggle it on/off quickly
- x button to remove the filter permanently
- types:
  * numeric: range (min and/or max), based on column metadata + histogram
    - min and max text inputs provide precision
    - |<-- and -->| links push either end to the edge of the domain
  * categorical: select one (or more) values from a multiple-select input
    - e.g. climate zones, zip codes
  * geographic: select one (or more) regions from a map
    - use categorical first?
  * date/time: value range, but...
    - encompasses multiple columns, e.g. "kw.total.{Jan-Dec}" and "HOD.mean.{1-24}"
- can you change the column after you've added it? (only for columns of same type?)
- each filter should be a form, to simplify event management (submitting the
  form triggers a change event if the text has changed)
